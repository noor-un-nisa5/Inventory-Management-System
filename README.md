"# Inventory-Management-System" 
*Inventory Management System â€“ Project Summary* 

This project is a Command-Line Interface (CLI)-based Inventory Management System built using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It manages different types of products, including Electronics, Grocery, and Clothing, using abstract classes and inheritance.

 *Features:* 
Product Management: Add, remove, sell, restock products.

 *Product Types:* 
 *Electronics* (includes brand and warranty)
 *Grocery* (includes expiry date)
 *Clothing* (includes size and material)

 *Search & Filter:* Search products by name or type.
 *Stock Operations:* Tracks inventory levels, allows selling and restocking.
 *Value Calculation:* Calculates total inventory value.
 *Expiry Handling:* Automatically removes expired grocery items.
 *Persistence:* Saves and loads inventory data using a JSON file (inventory.json).

 *Technologies Used:* 
 *Python* (OOP, Exception Handling, File I/O)
 *JSON* for persistent data storage

 *OOP Concepts Applied:* 
 *Abstraction:* Base Product class with abstract methods.
 *Inheritance:* Specialized product classes inherit from Product.
 *Encapsulation:* Data and operations are organized in classes.
 *Polymorphism:* Different product types override behavior as needed.

 _That's all for the project._
